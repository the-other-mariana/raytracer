# Raytracing Algorithm for Object Visualization

This project consists of a raytracer implementation in Java. It renders .obj files and spheres with either a Lambert or Blinn-Phong shaders. The program includes reflection (recursive), refraction, multiple lights, shadows (optional) and also affine transformations of the objects such as three-axis rotation, scaling and translation.

## Specifications

Java version (JRE or JDK): `jre1.8.0_241`
Execution environment: `JavaSE-1.8`


## Usage

Download the folder `RayTracer15_MarianaAvalos` and store it in your computer.<br />
Import the folder to Eclipse IDE.<br />
Run `RayTracing.java`.<br />
On the `files` folder you can add .OBJ files to render.<br />
On the class `SampleScene.java` you can change the objects that are rendered in the scene.<br />

## Sample output
The program outputs three different scenes. The first scene focuses mainly on the rendering of refraction. This is the output of the first scene:<br />
